# `planet_utils`

This is a simple Python library for interfacing with the [Planet Labs API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/api/).

It has two modules:

## Search

Locates image IDs for geometries and corresponding dates.  

## Download

`WholeDownload` and `CroppedDownload` either downloads entire images from Planet to a given destination or uses the Clips API to clip and download an image.

*This module is under active development and may change at any time. Use at your own risk*.
